# odin-recipes Project
### Introduction

This is the project being created while reading the first Foundations course on the ODIN PROJECT.

### Brief Summary
We have been tasked to create a recipe website in vanilla HTML.

I went ahead a did that

### What Skills I am demonstrating?
- How to organise my folder structure in a meaningful way
- How to match recipes to cuisines so that website flows naturally. People usually search by cuisine and don't have an exact way of choosing a specific thing to eat.
- I think I have repeatedly typed the HTML structure so many times that I have memorized it.
- How to link to other pages in my own website.
- How to link to other pages without losing my own website's tab
