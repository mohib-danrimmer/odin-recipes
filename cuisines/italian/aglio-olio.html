        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ cup of olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon of chilli oil or dried chilli flakes

    <h2>Follow These Steps (But not to the letter)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preparing the Spaghetti:</strong> Boil a pot of generously salted (approx. 2 tablespoons) water and place 200g pasta in to cook until al dente for about 5-7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Chopping Things: </strong>Meanwhile, finely slice 4 cloves of garlic and finely chop 1 handful of parsley.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Preparing the Olio: </strong>Heat a large pan with 1 tbsp olive oil and once shimmering, add in the garlic and1 tsp of chilli oil and cook for 3 minutes on medium low heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mix It Up, Baby: </strong>Once the spaghetti is al dente, transfer from the pot directly into the pan, pour in ½ cup of the starchy pasta water and toss till the water and oil emulsifies into a sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Final touches: </strong>Turn off the heat. Throw in the parsley, some grated zest and juice of one lemon and 1 tbsp of cheese and give it one final stir. Add some extra pasta water if the sauce looks dry.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Plate It Nice: </strong>Transfer to a platter and dress with some extra chilli oil and parsley on top before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
